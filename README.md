a bit of fun playing with simpleaichat - https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat

choose a character to talk to and save your sessions to a text file


- get an openai account.. https://platform.openai.com/

- once you have an openai account and are logged in, you can find the option for API keys in the Personal menu at the top-right of the webpage
