a bit of fun playing with simpleaichat - https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat

choose a character to talk to and save your sessions to a text file

get yourself an openai api key..

once you have an openai account and are logged in, you can find the option for API keys in the Personal menu at the top-right of https://platform.openai.com/

get simpleaichat installed..

done! have fun!
