a bit of fun playing with simpleaichat - https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat

choose a character to talk to and save your sessions to a text file

get yourself an openai api key..

once you have an openai account and are logged in, you can find the option for API keys in the Personal menu at the top-right of https://platform.openai.com/

get simpleaichat installed..

done! have fun!

if you share your version, remember to write the file you keep your key in (ie. .env in my script) in a .gitignore file. 

putting .* in the .gitignore file protects all dot files from uploading which can be good. 

also add session and log.txt to the .gitignore file
